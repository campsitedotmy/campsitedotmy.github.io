			<p>During the ancient times, Cyrus the Younger marched with his army through Cilicia, Syria, and Phoenicia. He reached Issi, a prosperous and flourishing city on the seaboard, where he was joined by his fleet consisting of 35 ships from Peloponnesus and 25 ships belonging to Tamos the Egyptian. Cheirisophus, a Lacedaemonian officer, also joined Cyrus with 700 hoplites.</p>
			<p>Cyrus then marched to a double fortress at the gates of Cilicia and Syria. He planned to use his fleet to lead a body of hoplites inside and outside the gates, but Abrocomas, who was guarding the Syrian gate, had left to join the king with an army of 300,000 men. Cyrus continued his march and reached Myriandus, a commercial port inhabited by Phoenicians. Here they halted for seven days. During this time, Xenias the Arcadian general and Pasion the Megarian left on a trader ship for home, causing rumors that Cyrus was after them.</p>
